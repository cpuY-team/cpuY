1. Acceptance of this Agreement

By installing, sideloading, or using cpuY, you agree to be bound by the terms of this End-User License Agreement (“EULA”).
If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the application.

2. Grant of License

cpuY Team grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use cpuY on your compatible Apple device.

You are not allowed to:

modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app;

redistribute, resell, or repackage the app;

remove or alter credits or copyright notices;

use the app for any illegal or malicious purpose;

bypass or interfere with any security or integrity mechanisms of the app.

3. Ownership

cpuY, its code, design, UI elements, and all associated intellectual property are the exclusive property of cpuY Team.
You are granted a license to use the app — not ownership.

4. App Purpose and Functionality

cpuY provides local device information such as model details, battery status, storage statistics, uptime, processor information, and similar metrics.

cpuY Team does not guarantee:

accuracy or completeness of all displayed data,

compatibility with all iOS versions, especially beta or sideloaded environments,

uninterrupted, error-free operation.

Use of the application is at your own risk.

5. Data and Privacy

cpuY does not collect, send, store, or transmit any personal or device data to external servers or third parties.
All data processed by the app remains entirely local on your device.

Because the app is distributed through sideloading, crash reports or analytics from third-party tools may not be available or supported.

A full Privacy Policy is available separately.

6. Updates and Sideloading Limitations

cpuY Team may provide updates that you may install manually or via your sideloading tool (such as AltStore or Sideloadly).
Updates may include new features, bug fixes, or security patches.

cpuY Team is not responsible for issues caused by:

limitations of sideloading platforms,

certificate expiration,

revoked developer profiles,

installation errors related to AltStore or similar tools.

7. Termination

This EULA remains effective until terminated.
It will terminate automatically if:

you uninstall the application, or

you violate any term of this agreement.

Upon termination, you must cease all use of the application.

8. No Warranty ("As Is")

cpuY is provided “as is”, without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to:

performance,

reliability,

fitness for a particular purpose,

non-infringement.

The app is designed for informational purposes only.

9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, cpuY Team shall not be liable for:

data loss,

hardware or software damage,

device malfunction,

security issues resulting from sideloading,

indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

You use the app entirely at your own risk, especially due to the nature of sideloading.

10. Legal Compliance

You are responsible for ensuring that the download, installation, and use of cpuY comply with the laws of your country or region.

11. Modifications to the Agreement

cpuY Team may update or modify this EULA at any time. Continued use of the application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
