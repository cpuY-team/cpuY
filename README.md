# cpuY


cpuY is an app for windows, macOS, iOS (and probably android later) with no ads and free

but what is cpuY. cpuY is a app made for monitor your phone, tablet, computer

with cpuY you can see: CPU, RAM, disk usage, etc......

developed on my macbook air from early 2015 with macos 15 

ia usage: cpu information why did i use ia for this: because it would take too long to search and put the correct thing and i still need to correct the ia writing

KEEPING THE APP FREE BABY

WARNING ask me first before doing a port/an aplication based on my code 
also if your app is made fully by ia dont use the name cpuY
