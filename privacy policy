## **1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy explains how **cpuY Team** handles user data in the application **cpuY**.
cpuY is designed to operate **fully offline** and does **not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or device data**.

## **2. Data Collection**

### **cpuY does NOT collect any data.**

More specifically:

* No personal data is collected
* No device identifiers are collected
* No analytics data is collected
* No crash logs are collected
* No usage statistics are collected

cpuY operates entirely **locally** on your device.

## **3. Local Device Information**

cpuY displays certain system information such as device model, storage usage, battery level, uptime, and other similar metrics.

This information:

* is processed **only on the device**,
* never leaves the device,
* is never transmitted to any server, third party, or remote destination.

cpuY Team **cannot access** any information displayed by the app.

---

## **4. No Internet Communication**

cpuY does not require an internet connection.
The app does **not** communicate with external servers, APIs, or online services.

Therefore:

* No data is uploaded
* No data is synced
* No cloud storage is used

---

## **5. Third-Party Services**

cpuY does **not** integrate any third-party SDKs, analytics tools, advertising networks, tracking frameworks, or external libraries that handle user data.

No third-party service has access to anything within the app.

---

## **6. Sideloading and Certificates**

As cpuY is distributed through **AltStore** or similar sideloading tools:

* cpuY Team is **not responsible** for data handled by sideloading platforms, such as AltStore, Sideloadly, or developer certificates.
* These tools may have their own privacy practices, which are **separate** from cpuY.

cpuY itself does not interact with these systems beyond installation.

## **7. Children’s Privacy**
